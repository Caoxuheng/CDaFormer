# CDaFormer: Cross-Domain Aware Deep Unfolding Transformer for Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Fusion
This is a super-resolution algorithm that adresses the problem of insufficient prior learning in recent deep urolled network.  
Experimental results on three public datasets and Worldview-2 Satellite images demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms six recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
